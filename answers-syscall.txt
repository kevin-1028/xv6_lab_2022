Q. Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall? 

A. usertrap () at kernel/trap.c:67

Q. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? 

A. p->trapframe->a7 is 7, that represent the number of system call exec().


Q. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in? 

A. user mode

Q. Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the varialable num? 

A.  lw  a3,0(zero),  s2

num = * (int *) 0;
    800020a0:   00002903            lw  s2,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
    
    
Q. Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions) 

A. The instruction p $scause is 13, representing a lad page fault; address 0 does not map to the kernel space, it begins at virtual address 0x80000000

Q. What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)? 

A. It can be observed that this user program is the initcode, which happens to be the first process in xv6. pid = 1
